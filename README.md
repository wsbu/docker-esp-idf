# docker-esp-idf
This repository represents the needs for development with esp-idf.
# Versioning
There will be times when the docker image will need to be updated. In order to preserve the esp-idf version in combination
with our own changes, the standard docker image tag will be wsbu/esp-idf:v[esp-idf-version]-[wsbu-version].
